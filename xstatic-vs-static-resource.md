## `StaticResource` Markup Extension
* Used to access `xaml` resource from resource dictionary (returns an object from resource dictionary)
* `StaticResource` markup extension is supported by XAML implementations that define a resource dictionary

## `x:Static` Markup Extension
`x:Static` accesses one of the following:
* a public static field
* a public static property
* a public constant field
* an enumeration member

**Note:** `x:Static` is an intrinsic part of XAML (as the x prefix reveals)
